In my first year at university one of my lecturers showcased to the class one of the apps he made-An app that translates sign-language into English.That inspired me to do something similar,someting that would be usefull and beneficial to Humanity.

Around that time The Great Nelson Mandela Passed away and I came across a saying of his on Facebook-"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."

That is when I realised an App that will teach people to read is the best thing that can be done. An estimated 122 million youth globally are illiterate.Hiring teachers to teach all of them would be expensive.So the best solution is to create an App that wil teach them.

What MY App Does:

The App listens to speech input from a microphone and compares the users speech to the text that is supposed to be read.If theres a mistake, the app corrects the user via text-to-speech and highlights the incorrectly read part,telling the user to read the highighted part over.If the user struggles,the app pronounces the word for the user.

What Were the challenges I faced When building the app:

Firstly, at the beginning when the idea was born,I only knew Java.I did not know about googles speech api or Javascript or anything.So I had to start from scratch.I learnt Javascript i a week.I then attempted to create a speech recognition app with Matlab.After a while a came across the google webspeech Api online and that saved me.The next challenged was the text-processing.I had to compare text recieved from the user to text stored in the reading material.This was a bit complex and took a while,but i finally succeeded.

Right now the App is doing the basic tasks.There a a few trivial errors that need to be solved.But I am hoping to get my hands on an Amazon Echo,Since it is perfect for speech recognition.
